Chapter 2:

eg_1 and others are examples/listings in the book

ex_1 and others are exercises in the book

Namespaces are important to know which function youre calling, eg. if theres two "cout" functions one is std in the std namespace and 
other one could be a user defined cout

comments are // for line and /* comment */ for multiline

Quiz:

1) Int main() is capitalized, int main() should be fine 
2) comments can be more than one line like /*  */

Excercises:

1) The program fails because Cout is capitalized and there is no beginning " for the Is there a bug here"
2) Fixed it by:
	Cout -> cout
	Is there... -> "Is there...
	void -> int
	added return 0;
3)see ex_3
